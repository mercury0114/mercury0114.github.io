    <h1>Our Mission</h1>

    <div class="text">
        <b>Breaking down barriers and stereotypes.</b> Yes, you can
        secure admission without being in top 1% of the class. No,
        there is no ideal applicant profile. Yes, education can be
        accessible and affordable. No, it is no a privilege only
        for well-off.<br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <b>Focusing on uniqueness of each applicant.</b> We believe
        that the key for admission to any university is the ability
        to convey your personal story. The admission committee is
        craving to hear about your ups and downs, your battles and
        winnings. We help to uncover your authentic self and show
        it to admission committee.<br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <b>Saving your time.</b> Searching for programs,
        scholarships, grants takes time. Writing a successful
        personal statement takes practice. Filling in forms,
        tracking application deadlines costs nerves. As admission
        process happens only once per year, we take care of all the
        annoying aspects of application process and help you
        focusing on the essential part of the admission strategy -
        your personal story.<br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <b>Planning ahead.</b> We believing that securing admission
        is only the first step in your study journey. Every
        postgraduate degree student keps questioning him/herself:
        What is next? How can I secure employment after the end of
        studies? Are my skills and knowledge in demand on the
        market? Which roles/positions can I apply for? What are the
        legal employment rules applicable in my case? Do not worry,
        we got you covered. We will ask all the questions so that
        you do not have to.<br>
