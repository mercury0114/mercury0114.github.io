- Add dual-language support, English and Russian:
	The translation for every piece of text should be generated offline,
	before uploading the website update to github.

	Use Javascript to switch from one language to another:
		-runs in a browser, no need to request server reload the page
		 when switching the language
		-most likely will be supported by many browsers
		DISADVANTAGE: ugly Java script code

	If javascript is disabled in a Browser, load English by default.

	To minimise work required translate the text into Russian:
		-Store every piece of English text in a file;
		-If corresponding Russian file is not present, make
			Google Translate generate it,
			when executing ./generate_html.sh script
	        -If corresponding Russian file is present (potentially manually
			edited), Google Translate skips generating it.
		-No HTML tags should be in the text files.
