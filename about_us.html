    <h1>Our Story</h1>

    <div class="text">
        Our story began in 2020 when we started applying for
        studies in Switzerland and United Kingdom. We felt scared,
        doubtful, uncertain. There were times when one of us wanted
        to give up.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        In 2021, after months of nerve-racking waiting, both of us
        received rejection emails. We felt low. Having each other's
        back helped us go high.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        We had regular check-in calls making sure that each of us
        is in a good mental and emotional state. We spent countless
        hours reading and correcting each other's documents,
        brainstorming, and kept doing the same all over again. Most
        importantly, we truly believed in each other, more than
        each of us believed in herself.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        Hard work paid off, and we achieved what we aimed for. In
        2022, Marharyta won a Chevening scholarship, while Vitalina
        got accepted to Geneva Graduate Institute with a full
        tuition fee waiver worth of CHF 25.000.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        We know first hand how emotionally and mentally challenging
        the university application process is. Let us lend you a
        helping hand and get you there!
    </div>

    <h1>Our Mission</h1>

    <div class="text">
        <b>Breaking down barriers and stereotypes.</b> Yes, you can
        secure admission without being in top 1% of the class. No,
        there is no ideal applicant profile. Yes, education can be
        accessible and affordable. No, it is no a privilege only
        for well-off.<br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <b>Focusing on uniqueness of each applicant.</b> We believe
        that the key for admission to any university is the ability
        to convey your personal story. The admission committee is
        craving to hear about your ups and downs, your battles and
        winnings. We help to uncover your authentic self and show
        it to admission committee.<br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <b>Saving your time.</b> Searching for programs,
        scholarships, grants takes time. Writing a successful
        personal statement takes practice. Filling in forms,
        tracking application deadlines costs nerves. As admission
        process happens only once per year, we take care of all the
        annoying aspects of application process and help you
        focusing on the essential part of the admission strategy -
        your personal story.<br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <b>Planning ahead.</b> We believing that securing admission
        is only the first step in your study journey. Every
        postgraduate degree student keps questioning him/herself:
        What is next? How can I secure employment after the end of
        studies? Are my skills and knowledge in demand on the
        market? Which roles/positions can I apply for? What are the
        legal employment rules applicable in my case? Do not worry,
        we got you covered. We will ask all the questions so that
        you do not have to.<br>
        <br>

    <div class="text">
        <b>Inclusion:</b> we stand for educational opportunities
        for all. In memory of our first client with vision
        impairment, we provide pro bono services to all persons
        with disabilities.<br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <b>Professionalism:</b> we tailor our services towards the
        needs of each individual client and the requirements of a
        particular university. We do neither copypastying nor
        copycating.<br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <b>Partnership:</b> our project is based on a simple idea
        that it is easier to walk the walk together, rather than
        alone. That requires partnership. For us, it is about
        having a reliable and trustworthy connection, which we
        aspire to build with each of our client.<br>
