    <h1>Our Story</h1>

    <div class="text">
        Our story began in 2020 when we started applying for
        studies in Switzerland and United Kingdom. We felt scared,
        doubtful, uncertain. There were times when one of us wanted
        to give up.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        In 2021, after months of nerve-racking waiting, both of us
        received rejection emails. We felt low. Having each other's
        back helped us go high.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        We had regular check-in calls making sure that each of us
        is in a good mental and emotional state. We spent countless
        hours reading and correcting each other's documents,
        brainstorming, and kept doing the same all over again. Most
        importantly, we truly believed in each other, more than
        each of us believed in herself.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        Hard work paid off, and we achieved what we aimed for. In
        2022, Marharyta won a Chevening scholarship, while Vitalina
        got accepted to Geneva Graduate Institute with a full
        tuition fee waiver worth of CHF 25000.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        We know first hand how emotionally and mentally challenging
        the university application process is. Let us lend you a
        helping hand and get you there!
